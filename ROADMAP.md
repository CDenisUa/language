# Roadmap

Task-by-task plan for Sprachlabor, in execution order. This is the checklist of *what's next*; for *what's actually built*, see [`CURRENT_STATE.md`](./CURRENT_STATE.md); for *why* a choice was made, see [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md).

## Resuming this project in a new session

1. `cd /Volumes/Projects/language`
2. Read `CURRENT_STATE.md` (what's built) and this file (what's next) before writing any code.
3. Pick the next unchecked task below.
4. Workflow per task, no exceptions: `git checkout -b feature/<name>` → implement → `npm run test && npm run build && npm run lint` all green → commit → merge to `main` → deploy → update `CURRENT_STATE.md` and (if a real decision was made) `DECISIONS.md`.
5. Deploy: `npm run build && npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=sprachlabor --branch=main`.
6. Repo: `git@github.com:CDenisUa/language.git` (branch `main`). Live: https://sprachlabor.pages.dev.

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1 — Project scaffold**: Vite + React + TypeScript + PWA (`vite-plugin-pwa`), routing shell for 6 pages, `ChepioTechFooter`, DE/EN theme switch (`useLanguageStore`).
- [x] **Task 1b — UI localization**: Ukrainian (default) / Russian interface switch (`useLocaleStore`, `useTranslation`), independent of the DE/EN study-language switch.
- [x] **Cloudflare Pages deployment**: project `sprachlabor`, `_redirects`/`_headers` for SPA routing + SW caching. Manual `wrangler` deploys — no CI auto-deploy yet.
- [x] **Task 2 — IndexedDB data layer**: `idb` wrapper (`getDatabase`), generic `createRepository()` factory (id/createdAt/updatedAt stamping), `words` store.
- [x] **Task 3 — Vocabulary module**: FSRS review queue (`ts-fsrs`), on-demand TTS pronunciation, Austrian-variant tagging + filter.
- [x] **Task 4 — Smart Scheduler**: `scheduleEvents` store (recurring rules + skip/add exceptions), `react-big-calendar` week view, `getEnglishSeparationStatus()` (pure temporal-separation logic — blocks English until 3h after German ends). Status is only *displayed* on the Scheduler page so far, not enforced elsewhere.
- [x] **Task 5a — In-app reminder banner**: `ReminderBanner` nudges English-unblocked (blocked->available transition) and upcoming/ongoing labeled schedule occurrences (e.g. "Mi Casa, Graz"), dismissible and persisted per-day. Notification-only — never gates Vocabulary/Shadowing (open question from Task 4 resolved, see `DECISIONS.md`).
- [x] **Task 5b — Web Push (VAPID)**: standalone `worker/` (Cloudflare Worker + D1, `sprachlabor-push`) reuses the app's own `expandOccurrences`/`getEnglishSeparationStatus`/`getUpcomingEventReminders`/`shouldFireUnblockNudge` directly (relative import, no logic duplication) on a 5-minute cron, sending via `@block65/webcrypto-web-push`. Client subscribes via `usePushSubscription`/Settings toggle and syncs schedule events on app load (`usePushScheduleSync`). Not independently verified end-to-end here — the browser notification-permission grant needs a real device/user gesture; see `DECISIONS.md`.
- [x] **Task 6 — Shadowing Lab**: personal audio upload only (no RSS/URL fetching, per the copyright decision), real-time play-along practice (not a segment drill), self-rating only (1–5 stars, no transcript/auto-scoring — see `DECISIONS.md`), live `SpeechRecognition` feedback on Chrome/Android and a graceful "unsupported" message on Safari/iOS, nothing recorded/stored beyond the uploaded track itself. Own IndexedDB store (schema v3): `shadowingTracks` + `shadowingSessions`.
- [x] **Task 7 — Error journal**: manual entry only (mistake + correction + category — grammar/vocabulary/pronunciation/other — + optional note), no automatic grammar-checking. Entries can optionally link to one existing Vocabulary word or Shadowing track via a picker; full edit/delete like Vocabulary. Own IndexedDB store (schema v4): `errorJournalEntries`.
- [x] **Task 8 — Dashboard analytics**: hours per language sums a new automatic Vocabulary session timer (`useStudyTimer`, visibility-based, own `vocabularyStudySessions` store — schema v5) plus Shadowing's already-existing `practiceDurationSeconds`; Scheduler's planned blocks deliberately don't count (see `DECISIONS.md`). Target balance is a configurable Settings value (`useStudyBalanceStore`, default 70% German, persisted like the locale/language switches), not hardcoded. Error-frequency breakdown reads directly from Task 7's `errorJournalEntries`, grouped by category.
- [x] **Task 9 — Export/Import JSON backup**: Settings gets a manual "download a JSON file" export and a "pick a file, confirm, replace everything" import (`src/services/backup/backupService.ts`), covering `words`/`scheduleEvents`/`shadowingSessions`/`errorJournalEntries`/`vocabularyStudySessions`. Shadowing tracks back up as metadata only (no audio Blob) and are intentionally *not* restored on import — see `DECISIONS.md`. Import always confirms before wiping existing data.

All nine roadmap tasks are done — the core daily-use loop (Vocabulary, Scheduler, Shadowing, Error Journal, Dashboard, Settings/backup) is complete.

- [x] **Text Analyzer** (was "CEFR-level text parser" in Deferred): paste German or English text on a new page (`/text-analyzer`, 7th nav item) and advanced words get highlighted inline, clickable to add straight to Vocabulary (prefilled, via a reused `WordForm`). Not a real CEFR wordlist — German has no open, full-range one (see `DECISIONS.md`) — instead uses openly-licensed word-frequency rank (`FrequencyWords` by Hermit Dave, OpenSubtitles2018 corpus, CC BY-SA 4.0) bucketed into rough CEFR-like tiers (B2/C1/C2/unranked), uniformly for both languages. Words already in Vocabulary show as done rather than clickable. Fully offline — the two ~500KB frequency datasets are precached by the service worker.
- [x] **Grammar module**: a new `/grammar` page (8th nav item) covering English grammar only (Ukrainian was the user's explicit choice for explanation language; the module is independent of the DE/EN study-language switch — see `DECISIONS.md`). 8 categories (Tenses & Aspects, Modals, Conditionals, Voice & Causatives, Verb Patterns, Syntax & Emphasis, Parts of Speech, Cohesion), 50 topics total, each with a theory paragraph, 3 example sentences, and 5 auto-checked exercises (multiple-choice or fill-blank) — 250 exercises in total. Content is static, bundled TypeScript data (`src/content/grammar/`), not fetched at runtime. Per-exercise correct/incorrect answers persist to a new `grammarProgress` IndexedDB store (schema v6) and drive progress badges at both the topic and category level.

## Deferred / not scheduled

- **Cross-device sync of app data** (words, review history, etc.) — still not built. Task 5b's `worker/` D1 database only holds push subscriptions and a schedule-events snapshot for reminder-scheduling purposes, not a general sync layer; the data layer's id/createdAt/updatedAt convention is still what a future full sync layer would build on.
- **CI auto-deploy on push to `main`** — currently manual `wrangler pages deploy`. Needs either Cloudflare's native Git integration (dashboard-connected) or a narrowly-scoped Pages-only API token; the only credential available so far is a broad account-wide OAuth token that's deliberately not being used for this.
